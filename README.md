# âœ¨ Randomization: Finding Meaning Through Random Source Generators

This app was created to practice several things: making AJAX requests, using jQuery and jQuery animations, to practice responsive web design, and to create a single page application. There are four APIs used to gather random data. The data includes quotes, activities, photos, and poems. A narrative was also created to enhance the user experience.

The landing page design was made py pikisuperstar at Freepik.com. I changed the design for each subsequential page with Adobe Illustrator.
